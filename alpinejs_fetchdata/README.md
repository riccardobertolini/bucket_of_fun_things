# Alpine.js fetch data test

Testing Alpine.js. Here I fetch some data when the user request it, clicking a button.

### Instruction
First, it requires the packages to be installed with npm:

```
npm i
```

Then, to run a local web server in the project directory to serve the HTML file.

You can use a simple command-line tool like http-server to serve the file. To install it, run the following command:

```
npm install http-server -g
```

Then, run the following command to start the web server:
```
http-server
```
This will serve the HTML file at http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.
